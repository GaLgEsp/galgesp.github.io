            <h3>Enjoy a new game with<b>4 posibles game modes</b>, adventure, survival, NPCs y <b>Battle Royale vs other players (NOT 100% POSIBLE).</b></h3><br><br>
            <h2>Posibility of the game modes:</h2>
                <b>Adventure 60%</b><br>
                <b>Survival 80%</b><br>
                <b>Vs. NPCs 95%</b><br>
                <b>Battle Royale 35%</b><br>
            <h6><b>That are the posibility of the game modes to apear in the menu.</b></h6><br>
            <h3>How to play?</h3>
                For now it's easy, you just need a mouse with the following buttons: Left click, right click and
                the wheel (It is a real button) if there is NO wheel, you will have to use the keyboard, if it does not have a left or right click,
                you can explore the semi-random map, the '' Black Holes '' eliminate you almost instantly, they only attract you from
                from a certain distance. There will be portals so to speak to change the dimension or place of the cosmos.<br><br>
            <h3><b>NPCs:</b></h3>
                NPC or non-playable character is the term used in video games to refer to
                characters that interact with the player or that are at the bottom of the level, an example is the enemies, the vendors,
                the immobile characters with collision or without collision.<br><br>
            <h3>Skins:</h3>
                The skins change the player's statistics, but they do not appear in Battle Royale, these are bought with a minimum level and a minimum of game money.<br><br>
            <h3>Niveles</h3>
            As I said before, there are LV (Levels), these are achieved with XP (Experience), the ways to get XP are
            destroying asteroids, eliminating enemies (Recommended) and spent fuel. <b> The higher level you are, the more it will cost to go up from LV</b><br><br>
            <h3>Tecnical demos/snapshots</h3>
            The technical demos or snapshots are trial versions with possible bugs, they are downloaded separately below the full version.<br><br>
            <h3>What is expected?</h3>
                A better quality game is expected compared to previous games made by me, semi-random world, a battle royale with a predefined map
                To avoid a generation of poor quality, the Battle Royale may never come out ... but the rest of the modes do.<br><br>
            <h3>Random world:</h3>
                The world is NOT completely random but the asteroids and planet positions are.
